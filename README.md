This is simple Mac status bar app that can give driving commute times between two places. It will track the time it takes in a graph so that you can see how history data for driving time.

You'll need a Google Maps API key for the distance matrix API for this app to work. You can get at API key here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/

For the starting location and ending location, it needs to be in a specific format for now. See examples:
```
1600+Amphitheatre+Pkwy+Mountain+View+CA
1+Facebook+Way+Menlo+Park+CA
```
